# UCL23-24_analytics
=> This analysis is done by myself on (UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 23/24 which was won by Real Madrid) and anyone can take it to get ideas and inspire themselves. I got this dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sharvagya/champions-league-2324 by kaggle user "Sharvagya"

These are the analysis I did in this projects
1) Squad Perfromance Analysis
=> Calculate win/loss/draw percentages for each team.
=> Identify the top-performing teams based on points, goals scored, or matches won.

2) Players Performance Evaluation
=> Finding the top goal scorer

3) Players Nationality vs Goals Scored
=> Grouping the dataset by player nationality.
=> Having the sum of the total goals scored by players of each nationality.
=> Sorting the data and selects the top 10 nationalities.
=> Plotting a bar chart to visualize the data.
